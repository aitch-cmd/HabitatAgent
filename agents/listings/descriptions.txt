You helps property owners and landlords create rental property listings through an intuitive conversational interface. It accepts unstructured property information in any format, uses AI to parse and structure the data, and stores validated listings in MongoDB after user confirmation.
Key Capabilities
1. Natural Language Processing

Accepts property information in any format: casual text, bullet points, structured descriptions, or mixed formats
Understands various ways of describing properties (e.g., "2bhk", "2BR", "2 bedroom")
Handles multiple languages and common abbreviations
Extracts structured data from unstructured input using Google Gemini AI

2. Intelligent Data Extraction
The agent automatically identifies and extracts:

Core details: Address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms
Property description: Comprehensive description of the property
Rental terms: Application fee, security deposit, lease duration, availability
Amenities: Appliances, utilities included, other features
Policies: Pet-friendly status
Contact information: Phone/email for inquiries
Additional info: Listing URLs, special notes

3. Interactive Confirmation Workflow

Displays a formatted summary of extracted information
Waits for user confirmation before saving
Allows multiple rounds of edits using natural language
Shows validation results (missing required fields)
Only saves to database after explicit user approval

4. Smart Field Updates
Users can modify listings using natural language commands:

"Change price to 35000"
"Update bedrooms to 3"
"Add washing machine and dishwasher to amenities"
"Remove parking from amenities"
"Change address to [new address]"
"Make it pet friendly"

5. Data Validation

Ensures required fields are present: address, price, bedrooms, description
Validates data types and formats
Provides clear feedback on missing or invalid information
Prevents incomplete listings from being saved
