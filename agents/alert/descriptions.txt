A conversational AI assistant that helps users create and manage real-time property alerts. Users can set up custom alerts based on location and budget, and receive instant email notifications when matching properties are listed.

## What This Agent Does

This agent connects to a Property Alert MCP Server to:
- **Create custom property alerts** from natural language (e.g., "Alert me for apartments in Brooklyn under $2500 at my@email.com")
- **Search current property listings** based on location and price criteria
- **Manage user alerts** - view, update, or delete existing alerts
- **Provide instant notifications** via email when new matching properties are added

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Alert Creation
Users can describe what they're looking for in plain English:
- "I want a place in Jersey City under 3k, email me at john@email.com"
- "Alert me for properties in Manhattan at sarah@example.com"
- "Looking for apartments in Brooklyn around $2000, contact: mike@mail.com"

The agent extracts:
- **Email** (required)
- **Location** (optional - city, neighborhood, or area)
- **Max Price** (optional - budget limit)

### 2. Real-Time Alert System
Once an alert is created:
- A background monitor watches for new property listings
- When a matching property is added, users get instant email notifications
- Includes full property details: address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, URL

### 3. Property Search
Users can search current listings:
- Filter by location and/or price
- View up to 20 matching properties
- Get direct links to full listings

### 4. Alert Management
- **View all alerts** for an email address
- **Delete specific alerts** when no longer needed
- See alert details (location, price, creation date)

## How It Works

```
1. User creates alert → "Jersey City under $3000 at user@email.com"
2. Agent extracts preferences → Location: Jersey City, Price: $3000, Email: user@email.com
3. Alert saved to database → Active alert created
4. New listing added → Background monitor detects it
5. Match found → Listing in Jersey City for $2500
6. Email sent → User gets instant notification with property details
```

## Use Cases

### For Apartment Hunters

### For Real Estate Agents

### For Investors
"Alert me for any properties under $2000 in Jersey City - I want to act fast on good deals."

### For People Relocating
"I'm moving to New York next month. Can you notify me about apartments in Manhattan around $3500?"

## Example Conversations

       2. Brooklyn - Max $2,500
       Would you like to delete or modify any?"
```

## Technical Details

### MCP Server Connection
- Server: `alert_service` on port 9002
- Protocol: FastMCP with stateless HTTP transport
- Database: MongoDB (`rental_database` collection)

### Alert Matching Logic
- **Location**: Case-insensitive partial match (e.g., "Jersey City" matches "123 Main St, Jersey City, NJ")
- **Price**: Alert max price must be ≥ listing price
- **Both criteria must match** for notification to be sent

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Uses MongoDB Change Streams
- Detects new listings instantly (no polling)
- Processes matches and sends emails within seconds

## User Benefits

✅ **Never miss a property** - Instant notifications when matches are found  
✅ **Set and forget** - Alerts run automatically in the background  
✅ **Multiple alerts** - Track different locations and budgets simultaneously  
✅ **Easy management** - View, update, or delete alerts anytime  
✅ **Direct links** - Email includes URL to view full listing immediately
